# Incomplete Uninstallation

Sometimes the Uninstaller may fail to completely remove all the leftovers of the Patcher.

If you face this problem, here is a quick guide on where you can find all the possible files & entries:

### Files & Folders
The Patcher saves its files in the main installation folder: C:\Program Files (x86)\WinTango Patcher
If you successfully ran the Uninstaller and this folder is still there, you can safely remove it.

### Registry
The Patcher also uses the registry to store some information.
Again, if you successfully ran the Uninstaller and these entries are still there, you can safely remove them.

Main Reg-Paths:
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WinTango Patcher 
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\WinTango Patcher 

Control Panel Icon:
* HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{77708248-f839-436b-8919-527c410f48b9} 
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ControlPanel\NameSpace\{77708248-f839-436b-8919-527c410f48b9} 

As some users may not be very familiar with editing the registry by themselves, here is a REG-File which will do the job for you. Just double-click it and press "Yes".

Afterwards your system should be cleared of all traces of the Patcher.
