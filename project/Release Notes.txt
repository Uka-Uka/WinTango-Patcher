GENERAL INFORMATION
-------------------
Icon Sets: Gnome, Gnome-Colors, Tango, Tangerine, Cheser, Elementary, Humanity

The WinTango Patcher is a mostly self-explanatory graphical wizard designed to make simple the process of modifying your system files with resources which are mostly inspired/based on Tango, GNOME, Elementary and many other open-source projects. It currently includes the mentioned icon sets, rounded out with various pieces of artwork created by myself and others. Additionally, it includes a Reloader module to re-modify your files if they are overwritten, allowing system updates to be performed without breaking the theme. If you experience issues with the Patcher, please consult the documentation.

Some resources are not official Gnome-Colors, are of unknown licensing, and are included for completeness; it is my opinion that they are appropriate and of very good quality, both visually and metaphorically.
