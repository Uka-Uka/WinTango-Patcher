# WinTango-Patcher for Windows 7 / 8.1 / 10 (x86/x64)

Bringing the look and feel of a Tango!-Styled Linux to Windows

The WinTango Patcher is a mostly self-explanatory graphical wizard designed to make simple the process of modifying your system files with resources which were created by the Tango Desktop Project, the GNOME Project, the Gnome-Colors Project, the Elementary Project and many other open-source projects.

The included reloader module will always re-modify your files if they are overwritten, allowing system updates to be performed without breaking the theme.
