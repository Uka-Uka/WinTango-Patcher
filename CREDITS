There is no team of underpaid illegal immigrants working on this project twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, three-hundred-sixty-five days a year; there is only me. I'm just a guy who has too much time on his hands, and enjoys tweaking and customizing things. I've always had a crush on the icon themes used in free software, but have stuck with Windows over various free operating systems, for various reasons. With some experience in writing code and pushing pixels, this started as a toy to change the look of my own machine, but maintaining and improving it for others as well has grown into a nice little hobby. It kills time and it makes people happy, and that makes me happy. It would not have been and continue to be possible without help from the many contributors to this project:

[Resource Hacker](http://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/), [UltraUXThemePatcher](http://www.syssel.net/hoefs/software_uxtheme.php), [UXTheme Multi-Patcher](http://www.windowsxlive.net/uxtheme-multi-patcher/) and [7-Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/) are included as a necessity of operation.

The Gnome Colors icon library was created by the [Gnome Colors Project](https://github.com/gnome-colors/gnome-colors) and is released under the GNU General Public License v3.

The Gnome-Icon-Theme was created by the [Gnome Desktop Project](http://www.gnome.org/) and is released under the GNU General Public license.

The Tango icon library was created by the [Tango Desktop Project](http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Desktop_Project) and is released under the Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike license.

The Tangerine & Humanity icon set was created by the [Ubuntu Art Team](http://www.ubuntu.com/) and is assumed to be released under the same license as base Tango/Elementary.

The Elementary icon library was created by the [Elementary OS Project](http://elementaryos.org/) and is released under the GNU General Public License v3.

Unless they contain portions of resources distributed under a specific license, my icon creations may be used under the terms of the CC-by-SA license, or the GNU GPL - whichever license is more convenient for you.

Some resources are not official Tango, are of unknown licensing, and are included for completeness; it is my opinion that they are appropriate and of very good quality, both visually and metaphorically. If you are the creator of any of those resources, consider their inclusion to be a compliment to your abilities and not an attack on your intellectual property rights.
