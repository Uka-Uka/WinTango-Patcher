The WinTango Patcher is a mostly self-explanatory graphical wizard designed to make simple the process of modifying your system files with resources developed by the Gnome-Colors Project, which is mostly inspired/based on Tango, GNOME, Elementary, Tango-Generator and many other open-source projects. It currently includes implementations of the basic Gnome icon set and the Gnome-Colors icon sets, rounded out with various pieces of artwork created by myself and others. Additionally, it includes a Reloader module to re-modify your files if they are overwritten, allowing system updates to be performed without breaking the theme.
