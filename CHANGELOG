    * The Installer caused IE 10 to not work anymore. As a result the installer will check for IE10 and automatically skip patching all the risky files.
    * “user32.dll” and “shell32.dll” have been moved to “Risky Files” and will be automatically skipped if IE10 is installed.
    * Video playback also suffered from IE10; therefore “setupapi.dll” has been moved to “Risky Files”, too.
